<h2>第<span class="afv" value="十七">18</span>章：罠をかいくぐって</h2>


<p class="orig">
The position wherein I stood does not appear very favourable to thought;
yet for the next moment or two I thought profoundly. I had, I told myself,
scored one point. Be Rupert Hentzau's errand what it might, and the
villainy he was engaged on what it would, I had scored one point. He was
on the other side of the moat from the King, and it would be by no fault
of mine if ever he set foot on the same side again. I had three left to
deal with: two on guard and De Gautet in his bed. Ah, if I had the keys! I
would have risked everything and attacked Detchard and Bersonin before
their friends could join them. But I was powerless. I must wait till the
coming of my friends enticed someone to cross the bridge--Someone
with the keys. And I waited, as it seemed, for half an hour, really for
about five minutes, before the next act in the rapid drama began.
</p>

<p></p>


<p class="orig">
All was still on the other side. The duke's room remained inscrutable
behind its shutters. The light burnt steadily in Madame de Mauban's
window. Then I heard the faintest, faintest sound: it came from behind the
door which led to the drawbridge on the other side of the moat. It but
just reached my ear, yet I could not be mistaken as to what it was. It was
made by a key being turned very carefully and slowly. Who was turning it?
And of what room was it the key? There leapt before my eyes the picture of
young Rupert, with the key in one hand, his sword in the other, and an
evil smile on his face. But I did not know what door it was, nor on which
of his favourite pursuits young Rupert was spending the hours of that
night.
</p>

<p></p>


<p class="orig">
I was soon to be enlightened, for the next moment--before my friends
could be near the chateau door--before Johann the keeper would have
thought to nerve himself for his task--there was a sudden crash from
the room with the lighted window. It sounded as though someone had flung
down a lamp; and the window went dark and black. At the same instant a cry
rang out, shrill in the night: "Help, help! Michael, help!" and was
followed by a shriek of utter terror.
</p>

<p></p>


<p class="orig">
I was tingling in every nerve. I stood on the topmost step, clinging to
the threshold of the gate with my right hand and holding my sword in my
left. Suddenly I perceived that the gateway was broader than the bridge;
there was a dark corner on the opposite side where a man could stand. I
darted across and stood there. Thus placed, I commanded the path, and no
man could pass between the chateau and the old Castle till he had tried
conclusions with me.
</p>

<p></p>


<p class="orig">
There was another shriek. Then a door was flung open and clanged against
the wall, and I heard the handle of a door savagely twisted.
</p>

<p></p>


<p class="orig">
"Open the door! In God's name, what's the matter?" cried a voice--the
voice of Black Michael himself.
</p>

<p></p>


<p class="orig">
He was answered by the very words I had written in my letter.
</p>

<p></p>


<p class="orig">
"Help, Michael--Hentzau!"
</p>

<p></p>


<p class="orig">
A fierce oath rang out from the duke, and with a loud thud he threw
himself against the door. At the same moment I heard a window above my
head open, and a voice cried: "What's the matter?" and I heard a man's
hasty footsteps. I grasped my sword. If De Gautet came my way, the Six
would be less by one more.
</p>

<p></p>


<p class="orig">
Then I heard the clash of crossed swords and a tramp of feet and--I
cannot tell the thing so quickly as it happened, for all seemed to come at
once. There was an angry cry from madame's room, the cry of a wounded man;
the window was flung open; young Rupert stood there sword in hand. He
turned his back, and I saw his body go forward to the lunge.
</p>

<p></p>


<p class="orig">
"Ah, Johann, there's one for you! Come on, Michael!"
</p>

<p></p>


<p class="orig">
Johann was there, then--come to the rescue of the duke! How would he
open the door for me? For I feared that Rupert had slain him.
</p>

<p></p>


<p class="orig">
"Help!" cried the duke's voice, faint and husky.
</p>

<p></p>


<p class="orig">
I heard a step on the stairs above me; and I heard a stir down to my left,
in the direction of the King's cell. But, before anything happened on my
side of the moat, I saw five or six men round young Rupert in the
embrasure of madame's window. Three or four times he lunged with
incomparable dash and dexterity. For an instant they fell back, leaving a
ring round him. He leapt on the parapet of the window, laughing as he
leapt, and waving his sword in his hand. He was drunk with blood, and he
laughed again wildly as he flung himself headlong into the moat.
</p>

<p></p>


<p class="orig">
What became of him then? I did not see: for as he leapt, De Gautet's lean
face looked out through the door by me, and, without a second's
hesitation, I struck at him with all the strength God had given me, and he
fell dead in the doorway without a word or a groan. I dropped on my knees
by him. Where were the keys? I found myself muttering: "The keys, man, the
keys?" as though he had been yet alive and could listen; and when I could
not find them, I--God forgive me!--I believe I struck a dead
man's face.
</p>

<p></p>


<p class="orig">
At last I had them. There were but three. Seizing the largest, I felt the
lock of the door that led to the cell. I fitted in the key. It was right.
The lock turned. I drew the door close behind me and locked it as
noiselessly as I could, putting the key in my pocket.
</p>

<p></p>


<p class="orig">
I found myself at the top of a flight of steep stone stairs. An oil lamp
burnt dimly in the bracket. I took it down and held it in my hand; and I
stood and listened.
</p>

<p></p>


<p class="orig">
"What in the devil can it be?" I heard a voice say.
</p>

<p></p>


<p class="orig">
It came from behind a door that faced me at the bottom of the stairs.
</p>

<p></p>


<p class="orig">
And another answered:
</p>

<p></p>


<p class="orig">
"Shall we kill him?"
</p>

<p></p>


<p class="orig">
I strained to hear the answer, and could have sobbed with relief when
Detchard's voice came grating and cold:
</p>

<p></p>


<p class="orig">
"Wait a bit. There'll be trouble if we strike too soon."
</p>

<p></p>


<p class="orig">
There was a moment's silence. Then I heard the bolt of the door cautiously
drawn back. Instantly I put out the light I held, replacing the lamp in
the bracket.
</p>

<p></p>


<p class="orig">
"It's dark--the lamp's out. Have you a light?" said the other voice--Bersonin's.
</p>

<p></p>


<p class="orig">
No doubt they had a light, but they should not use it. It was come to the
crisis now, and I rushed down the steps and flung myself against the door.
Bersonin had unbolted it and it gave way before me. The Belgian stood
there sword in hand, and Detchard was sitting on a couch at the side of
the room. In astonishment at seeing me, Bersonin recoiled; Detchard jumped
to his sword. I rushed madly at the Belgian: he gave way before me, and I
drove him up against the wall. He was no swordsman, though he fought
bravely, and in a moment he lay on the floor before me. I turned--Detchard
was not there. Faithful to his orders, he had not risked a fight with me,
but had rushed straight to the door of the King's room, opened it and
slammed it behind him. Even now he was at his work inside.
</p>

<p></p>


<p class="orig">
And surely he would have killed the King, and perhaps me also, had it not
been for one devoted man who gave his life for the King. For when I forced
the door, the sight I saw was this: the King stood in the corner of the
room: broken by his sickness, he could do nothing; his fettered hands
moved uselessly up and down, and he was laughing horribly in half-mad
delirium. Detchard and the doctor were together in the middle of the room;
and the doctor had flung himself on the murderer, pinning his hands to his
sides for an instant. Then Detchard wrenched himself free from the feeble
grip, and, as I entered, drove his sword through the hapless man. Then he
turned on me, crying:
</p>

<p></p>


<p class="orig">
"At last!"
</p>

<p></p>


<p class="orig">
We were sword to sword. By blessed chance, neither he nor Bersonin had
been wearing their revolvers. I found them afterwards, ready loaded, on
the mantelpiece of the outer room: it was hard by the door, ready to their
hands, but my sudden rush in had cut off access to them. Yes, we were man
to man: and we began to fight, silently, sternly, and hard. Yet I remember
little of it, save that the man was my match with the sword--say, and
more, for he knew more tricks than I; and that he forced me back against
the bars that guarded the entrance to "Jacob's Ladder." And I saw a smile
on his face, and he wounded me in the left arm.
</p>

<p></p>


<p class="orig">
No glory do I take for that contest. I believe that the man would have
mastered me and slain me, and then done his butcher's work, for he was the
most skilful swordsman I have ever met; but even as he pressed me hard,
the half-mad, wasted, wan creature in the corner leapt high in lunatic
mirth, shrieking:
</p>

<p></p>


<p class="orig">
"It's cousin Rudolf! Cousin Rudolf! I'll help you, cousin Rudolf!" and
catching up a chair in his hands (he could but just lift it from the
ground and hold it uselessly before him) he came towards us. Hope came to
me. "Come on!" I cried. "Come on! Drive it against his legs."
</p>

<p></p>


<p class="orig">
Detchard replied with a savage thrust. He all but had me.
</p>

<p></p>


<p class="orig">
"Come on! Come on, man!" I cried. "Come and share the fun!"
</p>

<p></p>


<p class="orig">
And the King laughed gleefully, and came on, pushing his chair before him.
</p>

<p></p>


<div class="img_fullpage"><img src="../img/prisoner_of_zenda,_the/c18_come_on_come_on_man.jpg" alt="チャールズ・ダナ・ギブソンによる挿絵：さあ、一緒にやろう！" /></div>

<p class="orig">
With an oath Detchard skipped back, and, before I knew what he was doing,
had turned his sword against the King. He made one fierce cut at the King,
and the King, with a piteous cry, dropped where he stood. The stout
ruffian turned to face me again. But his own hand had prepared his
destruction: for in turning he trod in the pool of blood that flowed from
the dead physician. He slipped; he fell. Like a dart I was upon him. I
caught him by the throat, and before he could recover himself I drove my
point through his neck, and with a stifled curse he fell across the body
of his victim.
</p>

<p></p>


<p class="orig">
Was the King dead? It was my first thought. I rushed to where he lay. Ay,
it seemed as if he were dead, for he had a great gash across his forehead,
and he lay still in a huddled heap on the floor. I dropped on my knees
beside him, and leant my ear down to hear if he breathed. But before I
could there was a loud rattle from the outside. I knew the sound: the
drawbridge was being pushed out. A moment later it rang home against the
wall on my side of the moat. I should be caught in a trap and the King
with me, if he yet lived. He must take his chance, to live or die. I took
my sword, and passed into the outer room. Who were pushing the drawbridge
out洋y men? If so, all was well. My eye fell on the revolvers, and I
seized one; and paused to listen in the doorway of the outer room. To
listen, say I? Yes, and to get my breath: and I tore my shirt and twisted
a strip of it round my bleeding arm; and stood listening again. I would
have given the world to hear Sapt's voice. For I was faint, spent, and
weary. And that wild-cat Rupert Hentzau was yet at large in the Castle.
Yet, because I could better defend the narrow door at the top of the
stairs than the wider entrance to the room, I dragged myself up the steps,
and stood behind it listening.
</p>

<p></p>


<p class="orig">
What was the sound? Again a strange one for the place and time. An easy,
scornful, merry laugh--the laugh of young Rupert Hentzau! I could
scarcely believe that a sane man would laugh. Yet the laugh told me that
my men had not come; for they must have shot Rupert ere now, if they had
come. And the clock struck half-past two! My God! The door had not been
opened! They had gone to the bank! They had not found me! They had gone by
now back to Tarlenheim, with the news of the King's death--and mine.
Well, it would be true before they got there. Was not Rupert laughing in
triumph?
</p>

<p></p>


<p class="orig">
For a moment, I sank, unnerved, against the door. Then I started up alert
again, for Rupert cried scornfully:
</p>

<p></p>


<p class="orig">
"Well, the bridge is there! Come over it! And in God's name, let's see
Black Michael. Keep back, you curs! Michael, come and fight for her!"
</p>

<p></p>


<p class="orig">
If it were a three-cornered fight, I might yet bear my part. I turned the
key in the door and looked out.
</p>
